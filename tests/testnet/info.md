## General

We want to have a testnet version so we can do manual testing in case we need it, all the info will be saved here.
In this testing we will do a `Juno -> Stargaze` implamentation, so Juno will have the tester and note contracts, while
stargaze will have the voice and proxy contracts.

We will also have a scripts folder that will contain scripts for easy upload and init of the contracts if we need to reupload/migrate.

We will also have an hermes folder that will contain hermes info and config file for our contracts.
